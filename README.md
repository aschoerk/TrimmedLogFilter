# TrimmedLogFilter
Method to filter logs so that only the currently important new content is shown


## Show only not yet known messages

* Messages are new
* The Level of a message is changed
* Timestamp are not relevant
* id-s are not relevant
* filter can be made persistent
** Idea: create temporary file which is reused if existent
* filter should be editable
** create view where each removed message together with the filter-template is shown.
